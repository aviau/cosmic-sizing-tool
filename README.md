 2. Add you language to the following section of public/javascript/app/app.js :
 ```javascript  
 $socpe.languages = [
    {id:'en', name:'English'},
    {id:'fr', name:'Fran√ßais'},
    {id:'xx', name:'NewLanguage'}
 ];
 
 $translateProvider.registerAvailableLanguageKeys(['en', 'fr', xx], {
    'en_*': 'en',
    'fr_*': 'fr',
    'xx_*': 'xx'
   });
  ```
    where **xx** is the code of the language you're trying to add.

#### Database configuration ####

Manual configuration is not needed. An sql script will be executed to create the missing tables when the server is run.

You may get the message `Database 'default' is in an inconsistent state!`. This is because Sqlite3 doesn't seem to work with foreign keys. Just click on *Mark it resolved*.

#### How to run tests ####

Write content here.

#### Deployment instructions ###

To build and run the application in the Play server, execute `make server`. It may take some time to download some missing packages the first time if you have installed *activator-minimal*.

Once the server is running you can connect to the application's webpage by entering ``http://127.0.0.1:9000`` in your browser's address bar. The first time you access the application, it may take a while because of the compilation process.

Use ``Ctrl + D`` to stop the server and go back to the console.
